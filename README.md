# AI_Final_Project

# Abstract 
An abalone is a marine snail and are found along coasts of continents. They are a delicacy and consumed by many different cultures. The purpose of this project and data set is to predict the age of abalone from their physical measurements and dimensions. To find the age of an abalone, it is done by taking a knife and cutting the shell through their cone, staining it, and then counting the number of rings that are there with a microscope. This is a very time consuming and difficult task to do so if the age can be predicted with other measurements which are easier to get, it would be very beneficial. The final model that was chosen was Light Gradient Boosting Machine and the results of the model was an R2 value of 0.5053. This results with the predicted age of the abalone being off by a year or two which is not the best but could possibly be optimized if unnecessary features are removed to reduce noise.
